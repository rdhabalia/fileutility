	  <!-- http conduit name * means it will apply to all host. For specific host, 
		you can provide the pattern like https://localhost:.*/bookstore/securebooks.* 
		possible values for Connection="Keep-Alive" or "close". 
		
		ConnectionTimeout = time out while establishing a new connection - in milliseconds. 
		ReceieveTimeout = Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the consumer will wait 
		for a response before it times out. 0 is infinite. 
		AutoRedirect = Specifies if the consumer will automatically follow a server issued redirection. (name is not part of standard)
		Connection = The connection disposition. If close the connection to the server is closed after each request/response dialog. If Keep-Alive the 
		client requests the server to keep the connection open, and if the server honors the keep alive request, the connection is reused. Many servers 
		and proxies do not honor keep-alive requests.
 		MaxRetransmit = Specifies the maximum amount of retransmits that are allowed for redirects. Retransmits for authorization is included in the 
 		retransmit count. Each redirect may cause another retransmit for a UNAUTHORIZED response code, ie. 401. Any negative number indicates unlimited 
 		retransmits, although, loop protection is provided. The default is unlimited. (name is not part of standard). 
 		AllowChunking = If true, the client is free to use chunking streams if it wants, but it is not required to use chunking streams. If false, the 
 		client must use regular, non-chunked requests in all cases.
 		ChunkingThreshold = If AllowChunking is true, this sets the threshold at which messages start getting chunked. Messages under this limit do not get chunked.
 		AcceptLanguage = Specifies the language the client desires (e.g., English, French, etc.). 
 		AcceptEncoding = Specifies the encoding the client is prepared to handle (e.g., gzip)
 		Cache-Control = Most commonly used to specify no-cache, however the standard supports a dozen or so caching related directives for requests.
